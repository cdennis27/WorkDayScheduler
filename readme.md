# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

Simple code for a Work Day Scheduler using interactive API's "DayJS" based on guidelines described on Challenge 05 of University of Toronto Bootcamp.

Daily planner saves the information on local storage, when you open again information "saved" populates rows according to hour on the day. 

Current date loaded on top of the screen. Time information not activelly updated only loaded once when page loaded.

User tasks are stored on client-side storage.

Time blocks color coded based on time loaded, reflecting past, present and future hours from current.

## Future Improvements

Possible improvements would be to set yearly planner.
